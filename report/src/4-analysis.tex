\chapter{Analysis}
\label{cap:analysis}
In this Chapter we consider the time performance of our project. We will focus on the difference and the speed-up between the sequential version, described in Chapter~\ref{cap:sequential}, and the parallel version, described in Chapter~\ref{cap:parallel}.

\section{Sequential}
Here we evaluate the performance of the sequential implementation of the program.

\subsection{Arena allocator}
In this \href{https://downloads.wortschatz-leipzig.de/corpora/eng_news_2024_1M.tar.gz}{test input file} we obtain a completion time about 18 second. After the implemention that allow us to allocation block of contigous memory, we obtain a total execution time about 10 second. This is a huge improvment in out performance. 

We see also the benefit of this approch during the freeing of the hash table. In the first version we took abound 2 second, while in the final version the free is irrilevan with 0.0027 seconds.

We saw the same effect also using the profiler. In the first version our code spend the approx whole time in system call operation (i.e., \texttt{malloc}); with the second approach the main time is spend in add gram operation.

\subsection{Time analysis}
Now we see the performance on the final test case.
